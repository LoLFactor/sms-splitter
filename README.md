# LOLTECH SMS Splitter

A Typescript library for splitting a message string into parts according to GSM specifications.

## Installation

This package is meant for usage in Node.js. Should work in the browser when using something like `webpack` or
`rollup`.

```
yarn add @loltech/sms-splitter
```

OR

```
npm install @loltech/sms-splitter
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { isMultipart, split } from '@loltech/sms-splitter';
```

### Is a message multipart?

```typescript
function isMultipart(message: string): boolean;
```

Given a message string, determines whether that string needs to be split up according to GSM spec. Return the result as
a boolean.

### Split the message

```typescript
function split(message: string): ISplitResult | null;
```

Given a message string, will determine its required encoding and split it into parts according to GSM spec.

#### Return value

If `message` is anything other than a `string`, it returns `null`.
If `message` is a `string`, it returns an object of the form:

```typescript
interface ISplitResult {
  encoding: ENCODING;
  extended?: boolean;
  parts: string[];
}
```

- `encoding` - Can be `GSM-7`, `UCS-2`, `UTF-16`. `UCS-2` and `UTF-16` are very similar, but `UTF-16` can also encode
  `UTF-32` characters. `UCS-2` basically means the string does not use characters outside the
  <abbr title="Basic Multilingual Plane">BMP</abbr>.
  
- `extended` - Only present when `encoding` is `GSM-7`. Signals the string contains `GSM-7` extended characters.
- `parts` - An array of strings making up the resultant SMS parts. 

## Note on behaviour

When splitting SMS messages for transmission, it's best practice to not split up characters.
This happens both in `GSM-7` (where extended characters are actually made up of two characters) and
`UTF-16` (where surrogate pairs are employed).
This library DOES NOT split characters.
While this is
[technically correct](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=technically+correct&iax=images&ia=images), it's not the whole story.
As can be seen in
[this particular patch comment](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/telephony/+/e472090%5E!/), some
carries cannot handle messages split within character boundaries.
Unfortunately the only possible solution I found will
be to use `Intl.breakItreator`, but that feature hasn't been
[standardized or implemented yet](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/60).
